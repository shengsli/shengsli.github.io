<h1 class="title">ThinkPad Addition</h1>
<p>
I have been a bit addicted to buying ThinkPads on ebay since I got my hands on my first ThinkPad X220T brought on Amazon. I will write down my thoughts about ThinkPad models that I have been looking up in the last few days, and my kind of unpleasant experience with an ebay seller. The main reason for me to write this down is that I found myself waste quite a lot time browsing on ebay. So next time I want to look up or intend to purchase one on ebay, I will refer to this blog. And this blog will convince me not to buy one. 
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
X220T: I am typing on my X220T right now when I'm writing this blog. I purchased this machine on Amazon UK a few days ago. Please don't judge me. It was my first time to buy a used/refurbished laptop. This laptop was refurbished by an Amazon certified seller PCandParts. It's a very nice and tidy laptop. I have to say that old ThinkPad is much more solider than these days' laptops. It's a pleasure to type on this machine. the keyboard is very light and has some texture compared to X200's which is a bit smooth. I can type on this machine comfortably for longer time, compared to my "modern laptops". I never expect a laptop can have such a nice keyboard. Modern laptops limit my imagination. Well, my dad had 2 IBM ThinkPads for work in the early days. But that was long time ago. I started programming in college and my first laptop for programming was a MacBook Pro 13" 2014. Don't laugh at me, I actually thought the keyboard on my mac was wonderful. I think that is because I don't type on keyboard too much before. So I easily got used to it. Some say X220T has a glossy screen. I feel it's alright. it does have some refection due to the Gorilla glass. So that it's durable enough for a stylus. It's mainly because my daily machine is Dell XPS15 with a hella GLOSSY 4K screen. Never buy a 4K laptop again. They are expensive and they make me blind. I actually placed an order of standard X220 on Amazon at first, but I cancelled it because the following trivial reasons: 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>tablet is more fun. I know it's stupid, but I have to admit it that I can't reject it. I want this experience. X220T can rotate the screen. It blows my mind.</li>
<li>PCandParts has better reviews than the other seller, but I expect the other seller won't be that terrible.</li>
<li>X220 is not Amazon Prime and it delivers one day later. X220T delivered one day later. I simply cannot wait to get my hands on it.</li>
</ul>
<p>
I think the first and the third one predominantly make me change my mind. I cancelled X220 and ordered X220T instead. And I made an order for standard X220 the other day. It will be delivered tomorrow. I now use X220T as my daily driver. I might switch to standard X220, because its smaller size. 
</p></li>
<li>X200: I brought X200 from a 100% positive review seller who does refurbishing for a living. It might be a company. Anyway. I brought because of those free software things. And X200 is rare on ebay. i don't want to miss it. It doesn't have a touchpad on it, so it's more interesting and unique in my opinion. I also has a fingerprint sensor. I think I am a bit too outdated. IBM/Lenovoo's early products have all kinds of features that laptops on these days have or not have. I don't find modern laptops have any particular feature that go beyond these old ThinkPads. And old ThinkPads' build quality is genuinely better than today's laptops. And time proves that these machines last over a decade and still work smoothly. It's nice and tidy overall. But it smells a bit. I am not sure if it is some smell last from last user(s) or it comes from alcohol for cleaning. It has a bit scratch on one side of the bottom. The keyboard on this laptop is a bit harder to press compared to my X200T.</li>
<li>X201: is an interesting laptop. I saw one of my fellow student use this model. It stand between X220 and X200. X220 has 16:9 screen ratio and Intel i-series CPU, while X200 is 4:3 and Intel Core 2 Duo. X201 has Intel i-series chip and 4:3 screen. If someone really want a 4:3 laptop with more horsepower, it's reasonable to choose X201 over X220. But I am tempted to get one, but I convince myself not to. This reason is not strong enough for me.</li>
<li>X60: I am very tempted to buy one X60. Installing libreboot on X60 doesn't require opening up the laptop chassis and plugging a raspberry pi or some single-board computer onto it, like X220. It only needs some work on software.</li>
<li>A22m: I am currently bidding for an A22m. About 6 days left for the auction. It's rarely used, in very good condition, as the seller said. It started from £17.99. Now I am winning it at £22. It doesn't have wireless adaptor. But from what I know on the Internet, A22m is the first ThinkPad with wireless adaptor. But this one that I bid does not. It's a 2000 model laptop. It runs Windows 2000. And it has an internal floppy disk drive. I admit it I am a bit addicted to buying. It's always a problem with me, not just buying computers. I buy this simply to satisfy my vintage interest.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Here is the unpleasant story about my buying experience on ebay. A seller called the techy something won't sell me anything. When I contacted them, they keep send me you can't help. I thought they send it wrong. at first. And I was stupid enough that I keep sending messages to them and ask why they can't help. But I realised that they just won't sell to me. And until today, I am fully aware of that. Not a happy experience. I was about to make a complain to ebay, as I feel the seller make it very personal and hate it they won't even bother to explain why they won't sell to me. But thanks to how ebay is good to hide its customer service contact, I find out that ebay seller can filter buyer based on some criteria. So, I comfort myself. Just move on and find other sellers. No hard feelings.
